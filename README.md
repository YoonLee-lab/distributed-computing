# distributed-computing (Calamari)

As smartphone hardware gets increasingly capable, applications are able to do a lot more - 
so we decided to write software capable of distributing embarrassingly parallel tasks across 
multiple mobile devices. Imagine having a network of 100+ different processors capable of working 
together towards a single problem. Over the course of the Hackathon, we've computed geometric 
series, simple sums, and prime numbers using brute-force methods on a network of smartphones 
receiving instructions from a python server. In the future, many more computing tasks could 
benefit from a crowdsourced computing, such as database querying, wide-scale facial recognition, 
genetic algorithms, and more. That's the goal of distributed computing

## Installation

Currently there is a functioning server-side written in python, and a client side written in objective-c
that runs on iOS devices.

Android and Windows Phone applications are currently in development and will soon be in source control.

## See it in action!

This was our final display as we presented this project at [BoilerMake](https://boilermake.org)
